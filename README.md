To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

## Usage

By answering prompts given in the command line, using node index.js as the starting command, roles can be assigned and given data values like name, email, and ID. The three roles are Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Each role has a unique identifier: Manager has Office Number, Engineer has GitHub Username, and Intern has School. Email addresses are clickable links that will open to an email and GitHub Username will direct to that Engineer's GitHub page.
